Project: EduCloud – Student Assignment Submission
Purpose:
- Enables students to submit assignments online
- Acts as the student-facing upload interface

Architecture Context:
- Static page served via Amazon CloudFront
- Submission handled by backend service (EC2 / API Gateway)
- Assignments stored securely in Amazon S3 (archive bucket)
- Metadata recorded in Amazon RDS (student, timestamp, file)
- Optional Lambda / cron job for validation and syncing

User Flow:
Student Browser
 → CloudFront
 → submit_assignment.html
 → Backend Upload Handler
 → EC2 staging / validation
 → S3 Assignment Archive
 → RDS Metadata Entry
 → Trainer Access / Review

Validation & Automation:
- File type and size validation (server-side)
- Naming conventions enforced
- Upload timestamps recorded automatically

Security Considerations:
- No direct access to S3 from browser
- HTTPS enforced via CloudFront
- IAM-controlled backend access
- Student data validated server-side
