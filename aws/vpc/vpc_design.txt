# ========================================================


## OVERVIEW
The EduCloud VPC is designed to provide a secure, scalable, and
highly available network foundation for the Trainer–Student platform.
The architecture follows AWS best practices using public and private
subnets across multiple Availability Zones.


## VPC STRUCTURE
- One dedicated VPC for EduCloud platform
- CIDR block: 10.0.0.0/16
- Two Availability Zones for high availability
- Separation of public and private resources


## AVAILABILITY ZONES
- Availability Zone A (us-east-1a)
- Availability Zone B (us-east-1b)


## PUBLIC COMPONENTS
The following components are deployed in public subnets:
- Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- Bastion Host (Jump Server)
- Internet Gateway attachment
- NAT Gateway


## PRIVATE COMPONENTS
The following components are deployed in private subnets:
- EC2 instances (Auto Scaling Group)
- RDS Database
- Lambda functions (VPC-enabled)
- Internal application services


## SECURITY DESIGN
- No direct internet access to private EC2 instances
- SSH access only via Bastion Host
- Database isolated inside private subnet
- Traffic controlled using Security Groups and NACLs


## HIGH AVAILABILITY
- Resources distributed across two Availability Zones
- Auto Scaling Group ensures fault tolerance
- Load Balancer distributes traffic evenly


## RESULT
✔ Secure network isolation  
✔ High availability  
✔ Scalable architecture  
✔ Production-ready VPC design
