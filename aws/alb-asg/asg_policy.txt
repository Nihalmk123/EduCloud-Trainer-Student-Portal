## OVERVIEW
This Auto Scaling Group (ASG) is designed to ensure high availability,
fault tolerance, and automatic scaling of the EduCloud web application.
The ASG dynamically adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on CPU load
and distributes traffic using an Application Load Balancer.


## PREREQUISITES
1. A custom Amazon Machine Image (AMI) created from a configured EC2 web server.
2. A Launch Template created using the custom AMI.
3. Application Load Balancer (ALB) configured and running.
4. Target Group (EduCloud-TG) created and attached to the ALB.
5. Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with private subnets across multiple Availability Zones.
6. Security Group allowing HTTP/HTTPS traffic from the ALB.


## STEP 1: CREATE LAUNCH TEMPLATE
- Create a Launch Template for EduCloud web servers.
- Use the custom AMI created from the configured EC2 instance.
- Select instance type as t2.micro.
- Attach the WebServer security group.
- Assign IAM instance profile: EduCloud-EC2-Role.
- Configure user data to automatically install and start web services on boot.
- Save the launch template for Auto Scaling usage.


## STEP 2: CREATE AUTO SCALING GROUP
- Create a new Auto Scaling Group using the launch template.
- Name the group as: EduCloud-WebServer-ASG.
- Select the EduCloud VPC.
- Choose private subnets (10.0.2.0/24) across multiple Availability Zones.
- Attach the Application Load Balancer.
- Associate the target group: EduCloud-TG.


## STEP 3: CONFIGURE GROUP CAPACITY
- Desired capacity: 2 instances.
- Minimum capacity: 2 instances.
- Maximum capacity: 5 instances.
- Ensures baseline availability while supporting traffic spikes.


## STEP 4: CONFIGURE SCALING POLICY
- Select Target Tracking scaling policy.
- Metric type: Average CPU Utilization.
- Target CPU value: 60%.
- Scale out when CPU exceeds 60% for sustained duration.
- Scale in when CPU falls below 40%.
- Cooldown period: 300 seconds.
- Instance warm-up time: 300 seconds.


## STEP 5: MONITORING AND OBSERVABILITY
- Monitor instance health via Auto Scaling Group activity history.
- Track CPU utilization and scaling events using CloudWatch metrics.
- Observe GroupTotalInstances metric during scaling events.


## STEP 6: LOAD TEST AND VALIDATION
- Perform load testing by sending repeated HTTP requests to the ALB DNS.
- Observe CPU utilization crossing 60%.
- Confirm new EC2 instances are launched automatically.
- Validate traffic distribution across instances.


## EXPECTED SCALING BEHAVIOR
- Initial state: 2 running EC2 instances.
- High load: Scale out to 3–5 instances based on CPU usage.
- Reduced load: Scale in back to 2 instances.
- Maximum limit prevents scaling beyond 5 instances.


## RESULT
✔ High availability across multiple Availability Zones  
✔ Automatic scaling based on real-time demand  
✔ Improved performance during traffic spikes  
✔ Optimized cost through dynamic scaling  


## PROJECT VALUE
This ASG + ALB architecture provides a resilient, scalable, and
production-ready infrastructure aligned with AWS best practices.
