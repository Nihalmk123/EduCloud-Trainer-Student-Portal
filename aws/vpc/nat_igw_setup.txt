# NAT GATEWAY & INTERNET GATEWAY – EduCloud Project
# ========================================================


## INTERNET GATEWAY (IGW)
Purpose:
- Enables communication between the VPC and the internet

Configuration:
- Attached directly to EduCloud VPC
- Used by public subnet route table

Used By:
- Application Load Balancer
- Bastion Host


## NAT GATEWAY
Purpose:
- Allows private subnet resources to access the internet
- Prevents inbound internet connections to private resources

Deployment:
- Created inside public subnet
- Assigned an Elastic IP
- One NAT Gateway per Availability Zone (recommended)


## WHY NAT GATEWAY IS REQUIRED
- EC2 instances need outbound access for:
  - OS updates
  - AWS service access
  - External APIs
- Security requirement:
  - No direct inbound internet traffic


## TRAFFIC FLOW EXAMPLES
Private EC2 → NAT Gateway → Internet
Internet → IGW → ALB → Private EC2
Admin → IGW → Bastion Host → Private EC2


## SECURITY BENEFITS
✔ No public IPs on private EC2 instances  
✔ Controlled outbound-only internet access  
✔ Reduced attack surface  


## ARCHITECTURE ALIGNMENT
This setup directly aligns with the EduCloud VPC diagram:
- IGW for public access
- NAT Gateway for private subnet outbound traffic
- Bastion Host for secure administration


## RESULT
✔ Secure outbound connectivity  
✔ Best-practice AWS networking  
✔ Enterprise-ready VPC design
